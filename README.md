# ML_in_Python
I have completed a begineer course in ml in Matlab and now im transitioning to python. This repo holds Jupyter notebooks containing well documented summary of various ml-libraries and all my mini projects to try out variety of functionality of different packages in python.


My plan:
1) Learn intermidiate level Python and gain a good grip over the lang
2) go through python libraries for machine learning : numpy, scipy, pandas,matplotlib, Tensorflow, Keras, Pytorch, Scikitlearn
3) Read about famous ml algorithms: linear regression, logistic regression, CART, Naive Bayes, K Nearest Neighbours, Apriori, K-means, PCA, Bagging with Random Forests, Boosting with AdaBoost
4) % mini Projects
